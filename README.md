🔍 Abstract
This project uses deep learning (CNNs) to classify Alzheimer’s stages with 99.77% accuracy. Techniques like T-masking and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) are applied to map structural brain changes. Explainable AI tools like SHAP and Grad-CAM enhance transparency by highlighting affected brain regions.

🧩 Problem Statement
Traditional Alzheimer’s diagnosis relies on subjective clinical evaluations and is often time-consuming. This system automates stage classification using MRI scans, improving speed, accuracy, and interpretability.
